  (substitute each line of stdout/stderr for a '.'
    -- maybe bring attn to an stderr line)

  cause apt fucks up paths for rubygems

* add tests for everything

* maybe stream output or do some sort of progress bar

* add ability to version gems -- by default take what is given..

* should ask up front whether or not you want to install passenger/mongrel
stack...

* add in user-management scenarios... (eg: deploy as www-data or root or..)

* should ask up front whether you want to install on ec2 or a dedicated host
